                                           consistent dilute color, much lighter in tone than the undercoat. The general effect is darker than a chinchilla golden due

                                           NOTE: during seasonal coat color changes on both kittens and adults, the "reverse" color on the kitten or adult is to be
                                           considered a NORMAL coat color change. At the root it may appear that the primary smoke color turns white a short
                                           distance up the hair shaft and then reverts back to the primary color. The tipping during this coat color phase may
                                           consume most of the hair shaft with only minimal white color deep in the coat.
